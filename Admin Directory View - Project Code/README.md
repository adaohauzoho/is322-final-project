Name of App: Cater-to-you 

App Idea: The idea of our app is to have a variety of catering services at the palm of your hand in which you can order food for a large group of people within minutes. Party planners as well as last minute meeting holders could utilize this app. Users should be able to place an order in as little as five steps. 

Both everyday people and restaurants and chefs could create accounts, and then they could be hired for assorted events of varying sizes, such as private family dinners, casual and formal cocktail parties, weddings, breakfasts and luncheons, corporate events and more.

This version of the app shows the user case scenario of a chef/caterer/ or persons with business accounts
checking the system for information on certain customers. Admin users are able to sort/filter the database
using budget or type of cuisine.
